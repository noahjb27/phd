One of my favorite parts of city life is the transportation system. There’s something uniquely satisfying about sitting on a train, headphones on, watching the city rush by—interrupted only by the occasional plunge into darkness as the train dives through tunnels. I get to know a city by riding its buses and trains, not necessarily to reach a destination but to understand the flow of the space around me. Public transportation, for me, is a way of transforming a city into a home.

Nowhere is perfect, but every place can feel like home—even if only for a few fleeting moments. Some spaces I’d like to linger in for years, others just seconds. Public transport makes that choice possible. As I gaze out of the window, catching glimpses of strangers’ lives, I am transported into all the lives that are and might have been. I don’t know what’s really happening behind those windows, but I love to imagine. Maybe it's escapism, or maybe it's just curiosity. When millions of people share a few square kilometers, but you interact with so few of them, there’s always that wonder: How are they living? What are their stories?

I am privileged to have the time and security to wonder about other people's lives rather than being solely preoccupied with my own survival. This luxury gives me the mental space to reflect, to imagine, and to ask questions about the world beyond my own bubble.

## Repetition and Frustration

Academics talk about shared practices, about the difference between space and place, about constructed communities and habits. Those concepts are useful, but in my life, what I notice most is repetition. Life in a city is marked by routines: taking the same route to work, catching the same train, seeing the same faces, facing the same frustrations. There’s a comfort in that predictability, but it’s also a breeding ground for frustration. When the train is just a few minutes late, when it’s more crowded than usual, when the winter coat you need to wear outside becomes unbearably hot on a packed train.

The very predictability that provides comfort can become a source of irritation when it falters. You know the train will be late, and yet, you’re still annoyed when it is. You stand shoulder to shoulder with strangers you recognize but have never spoken to, united only by the collective frustration of a delayed commute. It’s easy to become arrogant, to think everything should work smoothly just because it usually does. But no city is perfect, and neither is its transportation.

We should always hope for things to improve, even if they rarely do. Some believe in the myth of constant human progress, this unrelenting march of scientific advancement, others don't. Either way, ideas get forgotten, work stalls, mistakes are made. Yet, we can hope, however, that hope is meaningful only if we actively strive for change.

## Through the Window: Lives of Others

My privilege means that while I depend on public transport, I’ve never truly relied on it. I’m an observer, peering into other lives through the fogged-up windows of a train. I can imagine the exhaustion, frustration, and anxiety that come with unreliable transit services. I think about the doctor running late to help a patient, the mother stuck on a platform, missing precious time with her family. For each of us, public transport means something different when it works well.

It’s not just about getting from point A to B—it’s about being able to live our lives, unhampered by delays and overcongestion.

## A City in Context: Berlin

Berlin: "poor but sexy", home to four million people today and countless more in its past. Like every city, it’s unique—a Cold War city split in two, each half ruled by competing ideologies. For many, Berlin is the symbol of that divide, a living testament to a clash of visions for the future.

The project I’m exploring hinges on what some scholars call a “usable past”. I’m skeptical of the term because, like much academic jargon, it seems needlessly complicated. Do we really need a specialized term for an idea everyone can intuitively grasp? What I’m interested in is using history to inform the future. Berlin is a fascinating case study, but the insights we gain from it could apply to any city.

During the Cold War, Berlin’s population was relatively stagnant, yet the city was torn in two, each side governed by its own vision of progress. By comparing public transportation systems in East and West Berlin, we can see which policies, plans, and innovations improved citizens’ lives and which failed. It’s not just about analyzing change after it happens; it’s about exploring what could have been. Today, with data, algorithms, and models, we can imagine alternative histories and assess their potential impacts with unprecedented precision.

## Looking Forward

In a future post, I’ll dive into the specifics of the project: its foundations, methods, and where it’s heading. For now, all I want to say is that cities matter to me. Public transportation matters to me. And I believe it can—and should—be better.
