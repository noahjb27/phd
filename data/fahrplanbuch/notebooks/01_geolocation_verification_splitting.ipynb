    "This notebook handles the critical task of verifying and enhancing the geographic data for Berlin's public transportation stations. Geographic accuracy is essential for spatial analysis of the transportation network.\n",

    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Quality Assurance**: Verify that station coordinates are properly formatted and within expected geographic bounds\n",
    "2. **Station Splitting**: Process combined stations that need to be represented as separate entities\n",
    "3. **Visual Validation**: Generate maps of station locations for visual inspection\n",
    "4. **Data Enrichment**: Merge refined manual corrections with the original dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first load data from both the original processing and OpenRefine-enhanced records\n",
    "2. Next, we identify and split station entries that represent multiple physical locations\n",
    "3. We then verify coordinate formatting and geographic bounds\n",
    "4. Finally, we visualize the stations on an interactive map and save the verified dataset"
